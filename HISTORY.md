Twig
====

* ENHANCEMENT: Support color-customizing specific property values by setting
  `<property>-style` in `.twigconfig`. For example:

      status-style: "in progress": "yellow bold", "closed": "red"

  Property values can also be styled with `--<property>-style` via command-line.
* ENHANCEMENT: Add zsh support for `twig init`. (GH-48. Thanks
  [runcom](https://github.com/runcom)!)
* ENHANCEMENT: Show warning if `~/.twigconfig` contains an invalid option.
  (GH-40)
* FIX: Unescape branch properties on display. (GH-52. Thanks [rcoder](https://github.com/rcoder)!)

1.7.1 (2015-08-19)
------------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Add Ruby 2.2 to official list of supported Rubies. (GH-47. Thanks
  [apuratepp](https://github.com/apuratepp)!)

1.7 (2014-07-29)
----------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Expand `twig init` to also create a default `~/.twigconfig` file.
  This uses a new `twig init-config` subcommand behind the scenes.
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig help <subcommand>` for showing help content for any
  built-in Twig subcommand (e.g., `twig help rebase`). To make a custom
  subcommand work with this system (e.g., `twig help my-subcommand`), simply add
  `--help` support to the subcommand (e.g., `twig my-subcommand --help`), and
  Twig will call it automatically.
* ENHANCEMENT: List built-in subcommands in `twig help` with short descriptions
  of each. (GH-32)
* ENHANCEMENT: Support `twig rebase --autoconfirm` for skipping the prompt when
  rebasing a branch onto its parent branch. To skip the prompt every time you
  use `twig rebase`, add `twig-rebase-autoconfirm: true` to your
  `~/.twigconfig`. (GH-24. Thanks [ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb) for the
  idea!)
* ENHANCEMENT: Suggest `twig --all` if there are no matching branches. (GH-33)
* ENHANCEMENT: Add Ruby 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 to official list of supported Rubies.
* FIX: Don't require a Git repo for initialization (e.g., `twig init`) or for
  showing help content (e.g., `twig help rebase`).
* FIX: Show units of time for relative time strings when not using English.
  (GH-37, GH-38. Thanks [matteosister](https://github.com/matteosister)!)
* FIX: Handle special shell characters (e.g., backticks, dollar signs) in branch
  names and property values.
* FIX: Disable unsupported string formatting in Windows. (GH-39. Thanks
  [rcdailey](https://github.com/rcdailey) for the bug report!)

1.6 (2014-03-04)
----------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `--only-property <pattern>` and `--except-property <pattern>`
  for including/excluding property names in list view and JSON view. Useful for
  hiding properties that are frequently too long to show in list view (e.g.,
  `todo`), or for hiding groups of properties that are just issue tracker
  metadata. (GH-25. Thanks [slucero](https://github.com/slucero) for the idea!)
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig init` subcommand, the new recommended way to set up
  Twig after installing the gem.
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig checkout-parent` subcommand, which checks out the
  current branch's parent branch, if any, based on its `diff-branch` property.
  (GH-34)
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig checkout-child` subcommand, which checks out the
  current branch's child branch, if any, based on the child's `diff-branch`
  property. If the current branch has multiple child branches, this subcommand
  lists all of them and prompts for a selection. (GH-35)
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig create-branch` subcommand, which creates a branch off
  of the current branch, and sets the child branch's `diff-branch` property
  automatically.
* FIX: Fix `(1y ago)` (previously displayed as `(1 ago)`) in branch list view.
* FIX: Make `property` a reserved property name, along with `branch`, `merge`,
  `rebase`, and `remote`.

1.5 (2013-11-21)
----------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `--format=json` option for printing branch data as JSON
  instead of a list. Useful for integrating Twig data into other tools.
* ENHANCEMENT: Add tab completion for all subcommands, built-in (e.g., `twig
  diff`, `twig gh-update`) and custom.
* ENHANCEMENT: Paginate help content where possible.
* ENHANCEMENT: Improve error messages `~/.twigconfig` isn't readable or contains
  invalid lines.
* ENHANCEMENT: Include default option values for branch listing and GitHub
  integration in `twig --help`. (GH-30, GH-31)
* FIX: Fix warnings when listing branches when a branch has UTF-8 characters in
  its name. (GH-20)
* FIX: Fix showing relative time for very old branches (e.g., "2y ago"). (GH-29)

1.4 (2013-08-07)
----------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Speed up listing branches by 3â€“4x.
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig diff`, which diffs the current branch against its
  `diff-branch` property, and `twig diff <branch>`, which diffs the given branch
  against its `diff-branch` property.
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig rebase`, which rebases the current branch onto the
  branch in its `diff-branch` property, and `twig rebase <branch>`, which
  rebases the given branch onto its `diff-branch`.
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig init-completion --force` for overwriting existing
  completion scripts. Useful for upgrading to the latest Twig completion
  scripts.
* ENHANCEMENT: Improve `twig gh-update` error reporting by listing the affected
  API endpoints upon failure.
* FIX: Deprecate `~/.twigrc` in favor of `~/.twigconfig`.

1.3 (2013-05-22)
----------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `--branch-width` and `--<property>-width` options for setting
  custom column widths.
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `--reverse` option for listing least recently updated
  branches first. This can be used in a config file as `reverse: true`.
* ENHANCEMENT: Make `gh-open` and `gh-open-issue` work cross-platform.
  (GH-18. Thanks [ixti](https://github.com/ixti)!)
* FIX: Allow getting, setting, and unsetting properties for branches older than
  the `max-days-old` option, if given.
* FIX: Abort `twig gh-*` subcommands early if working in a non-Github
  repository.

1.2.1 (2013-05-04)
------------------
* FIX: Add User-Agent string to `twig gh-update` GitHub requests to comply with
  GitHub API v3.

1.2 (2013-03-21)
----------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `--only-<property>` and `--except-<property>` options for
  filtering custom properties by value.
* ENHANCEMENT: Simplify setup for writing GitHub-related Twig subcommands.
* FIX: Fix showing `twig --help` outside of a Git repository. (GH-16. Thanks
  [ryangreenberg](https://github.com/ryangreenberg)!)
* FIX: Fix showing `twig --version` outside of a Git repository.
* FIX: Fix the project's homepage URL in `twig --help`. (GH-17. Thanks
  [ryangreenberg](https://github.com/ryangreenberg)!)

1.1 (2013-03-06)
----------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Add branch name tab completion for `-b` and `--branch` options.
  (GH-12)
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `--header-style` option for changing the column headers'
  colors and weights. (GH-11. Thanks [tsujigiri](https://github.com/tsujigiri)!)
* ENHANCEMENT: Add `twig gh-open-issue` for opening a branch's GitHub issue, if
  any, in a browser.
* FIX: Make `branch` a reserved property name, along with `merge`, `rebase`, and
  `remote`.
* FIX: Handle line breaks gracefully in `~/.twigrc` config file.
* FIX: Exit with a non-zero status when trying to get or unset a branch property
  that isn't set, or trying to set a branch property to an invalid value.
* FIX: Don't allow getting/setting/unsetting a branch property whose name is an
  empty string.

1.0.1 (2013-02-13)
------------------
* ENHANCEMENT: Add Travis CI integration for running tests in multiple versions
  of Ruby.
* FIX: Gracefully handle Git config settings where the value is missing.
  (GH-1. Thanks [chrismanderson](https://github.com/chrismanderson)!)

  (GH-7. Thanks [joelmoss](https://github.com/joelmoss)!)
* FIX: Suppress `which` errors.
  (GH-9. Thanks [badboy](https://github.com/badboy)!)
* FIX: Exit with a non-zero status when trying to get a branch property that
  doesn't exist.
